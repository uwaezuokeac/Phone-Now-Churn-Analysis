## ETL
Power BI desktop was launched and connected to Excel workshop as that is the format of the dataset. Lots of transformation process was carried out such:
-Checked all the tables, rows and columns to ensure consistent formatting, no missing values and duplicate values. 
-Used first row as header
After these, I closed and applied settings to start analysis

## DAX measures calculations
The following measures were calculated to aid my analysis.

### Analysis and Visualization
Using the mockup draft and following the report requirements, I built the dashboard as required.

### Interpretation
-	A total of 1869 customers (26.5%) have churned accounting for a total monthly loss of £139.13K and annual loss of £2.86M
-	There is no significant difference on the gender of the customers who have churned
-	Approximately 64% of the customers who churned have partners, 83% have dependents and 75% are senior citizens
-	Month-to-month contract type makes up a whopping 89% of the customers who churned while electronic payment type makes up more than half (57%) of the customers who churned.
-	Fibre optic internet service type accounted for 69% of the customers who churned while about half of the customers who did not subscribe to streaming TV also churned.
### Recommendation
-	Increase sale of 1- and 2-year contracts by 10% each
-	Increase automatic payments by 5%
-	Increase sale of DSL internet service by 10%
-	Conduct diagnostic analysis on electronic check payment method and fibre optic internet services to determine the possible causes of the high rate of churn
-	Customers who are without partners, dependents nor senior citizens should be targeted more during advertising.
